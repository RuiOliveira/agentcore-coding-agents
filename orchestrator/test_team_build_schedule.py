"""A two-builder team build does each check once, on the branch it merges into.

October 13, run_080920_e788d0efcc9d (auto merge, 12.7 min): the checker waited for
the slowest builder, wrote both checks one after another, and finalization waited for
both. After the backend merged, Codex was re-run on the new base and produced a
byte-identical patch, and its check was written a second time because the base moved.
Under auto merge a pull request whose dependency merges first now gets its check
written once, after that merge, and a clean rebase is republished without re-running
its builder. Every verdict rule is unchanged: each pull request is still checked and
reviewed against the branch as it stands, and a red check still gets one repair.
